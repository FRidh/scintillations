# scintillations

Waves propagating through the atmosphere are affected by atmospheric turbulence.
For example, when listening to a distant aircraft you can hear the level fluctuate over time.
These fluctuations are known as scintillations. This module includes example code to generate sequences of scintillations.
The method was developed to generate more realistic aircraft auralizations.
